###### Teach Together will be a full-stack Ruby on Rails app using a postgres database. The app will allow anyone to create a unit or lesson plan uising the generator.
###### Users will be able to log in, save their unit or lesson plans, create networks with other teachers and collaborate on unit plan creation.

One of the many short comings in the U.S. education system is that there is no way to ensure congruence in the content that students learn. This creates a disparity of knowledge between students as they move up in grades and are exposed to new classmates and teachers throughout their educational careers. It not only causes great frustration for the students on the lowerend of this learning curve, but it also poses a problem to educators who are now faced with the challenge of educating a group of students at such varying levels of learning.

It has been shown that collaboration between teachers within a school leads to greater overall learning otucomes for students in that school, and helps to decrease the overall disparities and learning gaps mentioned above.

I plan to create Teach Together to make it even easier for teachers to work together in the top-down planning of the education plan for the students in the school.

Through this app, teachers will be able to form networks where they can collaborate on the creation of units and lesson plans together in an efficient and convenient manner, leading to a fair and uniform distribution of knowledge to all students in a school.
